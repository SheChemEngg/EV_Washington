# EV_Washington

OBJECTIVE

The goal of this study is to create models to understand the practices and incentives of the population of the state of Washington regarding the use of EVs and to implement the main factors involved in predicting its future trend.
Understanding how various demographic, economic, and geographic factors influence EV ownership is key to predicting future adoption patterns and informing policy-making.

This project aims to analyze and model EV adoption trends across Washington’s counties using publicly available datasets.  Specifically, we seek to uncover how population size, median household income, and regional characteristics correlate with EV registration rates.

The goal of this Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is to understand the structure and quality of the data, identify key relationships, and highlight patterns that will later guide the development of predictive models.
